# JSC370 Final Project

## Beijing PM2.5 Concentration Analysis

PM2.5 denotes air pollutant particles with diameters smaller than 2.5 micrometers. PM2.5 has been a large health concern, and this project intends to analyse the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, China. At the end of the analysis, the goal is to find a way to predict the PM2.5 concentration with forecastable meteological measures and find out when is the best time to go outside.
